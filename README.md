# Student Exam Score Prediction Project

## Overview
This comprehensive machine learning project predicts students' exam scores based on various academic, demographic, and lifestyle factors. The project implements multiple regression models and provides insights into the key factors influencing student performance.

## Project Objectives
- Predict student exam scores with high accuracy
- Identify key factors influencing academic performance
- Provide actionable insights for students and educators
- Compare multiple machine learning approaches

## Dataset
- **Size**: 10,000 student records
- **Features**: 15 input variables including:
  - Study hours per week
  - Assignment completion rate
  - Attendance rate
  - Learning preferences
  - Stress levels
  - Sleep patterns
  - Demographics

## Machine Learning Models
1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline model for interpretability
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble method for non-linear relationships
3. **Gradient Boosting** - Advanced ensemble for best performance

## Key Results
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Performance**: RÂ² = 0.xxx, RMSE = x.x points
- **Accuracy**: xx% of predictions within Â±5 points

## Key Insights
1. **Most Important Factors**:
   - Assignment completion rate
   - Study hours per week
   - Attendance rate
   - Final grade correlation
   - Academic engagement score

2. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - Maintain consistent study schedule
   - Focus on assignment completion
   - Regular class attendance
   - Adequate sleep (7-8 hours)
   - Active participation in discussions
